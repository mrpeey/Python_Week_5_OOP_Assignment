# Python_Week_5_OOP_Assignment

Activity 1

This program showcases a base class, Book class, with attributes and methods to bring the class to life. Ebook class inherits from the base class. The library uses checked_out method to check how many copies are left and print their number and check_in method to add a new copy to library and also print the number of copies available. The get_decription method prints the description of the Book or Ebook such as title, author, publishing_year, available_copies, format and pages. 


Activity 2

This program represents the base class vehicle with its subclasses, which inherit from the base class, with the same move action. But uses the power of polymorphism to determine which method should be executed depending on the type of the vehicle that is moving. For instance, when a Car is moving a message "driving" is printed and when the Plane is moving a message "Flying" is printed and also when the Boat is moving the message !Sailing" is printed.
